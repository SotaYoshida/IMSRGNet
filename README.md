# IMSRGNet
Code and data of IMSRG-Net: arXiv:xxxxx

* imsrgnet.py: sample code to train the IMSRG-Net and to make operator files (in hd5 fmt used in NuclearToolkit.jl).
* runlog: model parameters and operators used in the paper

I do not include all the operator files for larger model space (emax > 6), due to the limitation of the file size.  
If you need those, please contact me!

# How to cite

I would be extremely grateful if you would create your own models using this repository and the NuclearToolkit.jl!
The IMSRG-Net may in future be integrated into my Julia package [NuclearToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SotaYoshida/NuclearToolkit.jl).  
Please consider to cite the paper for [IMSRG-Net](url) and [NuclearToolkit.jl](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04694) (not this repository!)
Thank you.
